  You would put '/n' at the end of the string where it will then print all of the following information on the next line.

What is the difference between single and double quotes?
  The difference is in how the symbol reads and interprets varous symbols such as / \ and allows for commands like /n to move it to new line.

Do a little research on apidock.com and find 5 methods on String that you think are interesting and could be useful.
  1) .rstrip() - returns a copy of the string with all trailing white space removed.

  2) .succ - returns successor to string.
  [1234].succ => [1235]

  3) .squeeze - returns copy of string with all runs of letters smashed into single.
  ['Whoop Moon'].squeeze => 'Whop Mon'

  4).replace - replaces a variable with a new one.
    a = 'chicken'
    a.replace 'turkey'
    a => 'turkey'

  5).concat - concatenates a given object to a string.
    a = 'hello'
    a << 'world' => 'hello world'
    a.concat(33) => 'hello world!'  (33 is the integer value for the ! object.)
