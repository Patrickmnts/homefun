What is your favorite color?
	#D65026

How old are you in seconds? (If you did this with only a calculator how would you do it?)
Birthday April 19th 1988
24 years 1 months 14 days
	(365 * 24) + 30 + 14
		8804 days * 24 hours/day
			211296 hours * 60 min/hr
				12677760 min * 60 sec/min
					760.7 million seconds old

What is a String?
	A group of letters, punctuation, digits, symbols or spaces in a program, surrounded by quotations.

What’s the difference between single and double-quoted strings?
	Double quoted strings support a wider variety of escape sequences.  While single quoted strings support \' and \\ escapes, double quotes are able to utilize \", \\, \a, \b, \r, \n, \s, and \t.

How do you use a quote mark inside of a string? (escaping characters)
	You put an (\) escape variable in front of your mark.

What is a variable?
	A variable is something that we want to save in order to call upon it at a later point in our program.

How do you put a variable inside a string? (interpolation or concatenation)
 name = "Patrick"
 puts name + " is really excited to be a part of PCS!"
 puts "#{name} is really excited to be a part of PCS!"

What does the to_s or the to_i method do and why do we need them? (type casting)
	to_s turns an object into a string.
	to_i turns an object into an integer.
		They are important because you cannot add integers and strings together so in order to execute certain programs a temporary shift of state might be required for the desired result.

<!-- Even Questions -->
How do you call a method on a variable?
	variable.method

How do you generate a random number between 1 and 20?
	Use the rand(n), where output will be within the range 0 < x < n.
		rand(21)

How do you define a new method?
	def method_name
		Making sure your method name starts with a lower-case letter, just like variables.

How do you define a new method that takes 2 parameters?
	def method_name method_name2

What is a method?
	"Methods are like verbs" they tell an object what to do.

What happens if you specify that it needs 2 parameters but you only give it 1? (arity)
	When a method is defined with 2 parameters, it must have 2 parameters in order to operate.  The computer wont know what to do with the empty space where a parameter was originally defined.

If you use a variable outside a function can it be used inside?
	No, Ruby will work to protect local variables within a defined method from conflicting with one another throughout the program.

If you assign a new value inside the function, what is the value of the variable
after the function? (overwriting vs shadowing)
	#<NameError: undefined local variable 'new_variable'>

If you don’t explicitly return a value from a function, what is returned? (implicit return)
	If you dont explicitly lay out a return value in a function Ruby will evaluate it to the last value of the statement.
		pg. 92 "The value returned from a method is simply the last expression evaluated in the method (usually just the last line of the method)."

	<!-- ODD -->
Why is 2 < 10 #=> true but '2' < '10' #=> false? (lexicographical ordering)
	The single quotes turn both '2' && '10' into strings, are then compared lexicographically, or by the order they appear in the dictionary.  Because 2 comes before 10 when counting lexographically it is greater.

What are the only two values that evaluate to false in Ruby? (falsy values)
	Nil, && False.

What happens if you use = instead of == in a conditional?
	Your assigning a variable with the single = instead of saying this condition is true when X equals Y. (true if x == y)

What keyword do you use to stop a loop?
	*break

If you end up executing an infinite loop how do you stop it? (SIGKILL)
	Ctrl + c

Why would you ever want to use while true?
	If you wanted you program to loop forever, or until it recieved a certain input that would trigger the break.

What do the && and || operators do? (logical operators)
 && = "and" All aspects need to be true for the method to return true.
 || = "or" if one, the other or both are true the whole line will return a true.

What is the difference between if !false and unless false? (logical not)
	Nothing. They are saying the same thing. Humans understand the word "unless" in a slightly different manner but to the computer they are the equivalent.

What is an array?
	An array is a list.

What does it mean for an array to be zero indexed?
	The placeholder assignments in an array begin counting at 0.  if you have 4 objects in an array they are counted [0, 1, 2, 3].

What is the method in 8.1 we use to walk over all values in an array?
	.each is the method we use to make a change to EVERY value in an array.  

What do push, pop, and last do? Is there a first?
	.push - adds the item to the last spot on the array.
	.pop - removes the last item in the array and tells you what it is.
	.last - tells you the last item in the array but does nothing to it. Think of it as a listing of what .pop would remove.
	There is a .first that tells you the first item in the array.
