What is recursion?
	When you call a method within itself.

When learning recursion, what is the defacto “hello world” style program?
	Taking a factorial of a negative number.

		def factorial num
			if num < 0
				return "you can't take a factorial of a negative number."
		end
		if num <= 1
			1
		else
		 num * factorial(num-1) *********DING DING
		end
		end

Use pseudo code to complete a recursive sort
	def sort some_array

	Hint: There are three steps to any recursive algorithm
		Check to see if there’s any work left to do and return if not. (early return)
		Do some work (reduce the problem)
		Call yourself (recurse) (sometimes 2 & 3 are the same step)
