In your own words, what is AJAX and why is it worth knowing about?(pg. 140)

=> Ajax is a way to load data from a server to the browser w/out having to visibly refresh the page.

* Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (Ajax): "at its most basic Ajax includes the following;"

  1. JS, to capture interactions w/ the user or other browser events.

  2. the XMLHttpRequest object, this allows requests to be made to the server w/out having to refresh and interrupt current browser tasks.

  3. A file on the server that presents the data in either XML, HTML or JSON.

  4. & More JS, to interpret that (#3) data and present it to the page.


How do you download an html fragment and assign it to a variable? (pg. 143)
=>.load()

What is JSON and why do we love it? (pg. 144)
=> JavaScript Object Notation we love it because it is far less bulky than XML formatting and it allows us to easily parse and select the desired information from it.
  We also have an easy method to parse the JSON string that is returned from the server with .getJSON(), which will also provide a calling code for each resulting object.

What function do we use to download a JSON snippet from a server? (pg. 147)
=> $(document).ready()
     function(){$.getJSON('JSON-URL',____)}


How can we provide a function to $.getJSON which allows us to act on the data after it finishes downloading? (pg. 146)
=> We would attach a callback function to the .getJSON method.
     function(){$.getJSON('json-url',function()}
    *the function within the .getJSON method would be our call back function that acts on our data after it has finished loading.

What is the .val() function useful for? How does it compare to .html()?
=> .val() = gets the current value of the first element in the matched elements or to set the value of every matched element.

  .html() = Gets the HTML contents of the first element in the set of matched elements of sets the HTML contents of every matched element

How do we specify an error callback for $.get? (pg.168)
=> instead of a success() callback method we can use an error() method.

  If for instance we chained our .get function to a click action and when we clicked the 'get' failed or errored out we could set a response to signal us somehow.  either through a console.log or by addending a snippet directly to the HTML.


What is JSONP and how do we use it to get around cross-origin policies? (pg. 172)
=> JSON w/ Padding.  JSONP is a standard JSON file that is wrapped in () and prepended with an arbitrary text string.  The string is determined by the client requesting the data.  B/c of the () the client can cause a functiong to be called... I am not entirely sure as to the meaning of this.


What are the drawbacks of JSONP? (pg. 173)
=> It allows for you to access and parse information from sites that may not necessarily be from a trusted source.  It allows you to bypass the reason they made it difficult to do cross-site scripts in the first place...
